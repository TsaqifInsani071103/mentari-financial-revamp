  //I think we can make an instance of this handler by each Statement made or something 

  //I think this should also take care of the StatementViewHandler like a middle man between the POJOS and the viewHandler, but I think the view itself will be controlled by indivProjectViewcontroller no?  

  //updateExpenseFormulaFields()? This immediately concerns the view so it should be in the view handler  

  //potential things this could do 
  //updateFormulas()
  //findExpenseByName() using while loop and not recursion hopefully 
  //findExpenseById() I think is better. 

  //we also need to make FormulaObject so I could test this correctly.
